FractalSaver
============

FractalSaver is a screensaver which displays an animated fractal. FractalSaver can also "play" the fractal music creating a strange abstract atmosphere. The visual and sound effects are created just using a simple mathematical formula and some mapping algorithms.
FractalSaver was written by Mihai Popescu in C++ using Win32 API and MIDI Library. Thanks to Dana Bogheanu the coloring and music generation algorithms were heavily tested and revised. Many thanks to Gabi Ciocoiu for doing all research and documentation needed for the project. The working code base of the FractalSaver is established by us, Hazard Team.
With the help and guidance of Razvan Tanasie, Computer Graphics teacher at the Univeristy of Craiova, Faculty of Automatics Computers and Electronics, this project won grand prizes at student competitions and the theory behind it was published in several articles one of them presented at the WSEAS - World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society, Vouliagmeni, Athens, Greece 2007.
This project was greatly appreciated by Dan Iancu, chief redactor at PC Magazine Romania, and it was distributed to millions of readers across the nation being included on the DVD of the 2007 PC Magazine September Edition.
