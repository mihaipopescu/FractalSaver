        What are Fractals ?</h2>
    <p>
        Dynamical systems are a well-known branch of mathematics, but until the arrival
        of computers the sheer number of calculations involved made them impractical for
        real use. The computer’s ability to perform rapid calculations allows us to condense
        billions of calculations into results we can digest. Benoit Mandelbrot was the first
        one to use computers to produce graphical representations of dynamical systems in
        the complex plane, based on the quadratic formulas described by the French mathematician
        Gaston Julia at the beginning of the 20th century.

        During the 1980s, fractal enthusiasts began exploring fractals for their artistic
        merit, not for their mathematical significance. While mathematics was the tool,
        the focus was art. As the fractal equation itself was the most obvious mathematical
        element, fractal artists experimented with new equations, introducing hundreds of
        different fractal types. By carefully choosing parameters to refine form, color,
        and location, these explorers introduced the concept of fractal art.

        After 1995, few new major fractal types have been introduced. This is because the
        newest innovations in fractal art do not come from changing the fractal equation,
        but from new ways of coloring the results of those equations. As these coloring
        algorithms move from simple to complex, fractal artists are often returning to the
        simpler, classical fractal equations. With the increased flexibility these sophisticated
        algorithms provide, there is even more room for personal artistic expression.
