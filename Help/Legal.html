        <a>FractalSaver Credits</a></h2>
    <p>
        FractalSaver was written by Mihai Popescu in C++ using Win32 API and MIDI Library.
        Thanks to Dana Bogheanu the coloring and music generation algorithms were heavily
        tested and revised. Many thanks to Gabi Ciocoiu for doing all research and documentation
        needed for the project. The working code base of the FractalSaver is established
        by us, Hazard Team.</p>
    <p>
        With the help and guidance of Razvan Tanasie, Computer Graphics teacher at the Univeristy
        of Craiova, Faculty of Automatics Computers and Electronics, this project won grand
        prizes at student competitions and the theory behind it was published in several
        articles one of them presented at the WSEAS - World Scientific and Engineering Academy
        and Society, Vouliagmeni, Athens, Greece 2007.</p>
    <p>
        This project was greatly appreciated by Dan Iancu, chief redactor at PC Magazine
        Romania, and it was distributed to millions of readers across the nation being included
        on the DVD of the 2007 PC Magazine September Edition.</p>
