<h2>Customizing FractalSaver</h2>
    <p>
        Before making any changes it's good to have a basic knowledge on fractals though
        a random setup always lead to the best user experience.<br />
        To unleash the full power of FractalSaver you must click the <b>Settings</b> button.</p>

        • By clicking on the small black&amp;white Mandelbrot image on the left you will
        notice that the Julia Fractal on the right is changing accordingly. The reason why
        this happens is that there is a direct link between the two images. You will find
        in the mathematical foundation of the two fractals that the link between them is
        the complex number <b>C</b>. The difference is that for the Mandelbrot set <b>C</b>
        is a <i>variable</i> and for the Julia set is a input <i>constant</i>. So whether
        the constant <b>C</b> is selected from the list or picked from the Mandelbrot fractal
        it is used as input for the Julia fractal. Higher complexity of Julia set could
        be achieved by choosing constants near the edge of the Mandelbrot set. Although, you
        can swap between the two sets by clicking <b>Swap</b> button.

        • The area on the right where Julia is drawn has zoom and pan capability having
        one constraint: constraint: the point where you have clicked must remain in the
        same spot in the zoomed image.<br />
        <b>Left-Click</b> = Zoom In (2x)<br />
        <b>Right-Click</b> = Zoom Out (2x)<br />
        <b>Middle-Click</b> = if you are in Big Mandelbrot mode you will select the 
        constant otherwise you will observe the obit of the point.<br />
        <b>Mouse scroll</b> = cycles the palette showing how the fractal will be animated<br />
        <b>Pan</b> = a series of zoom in/out<br />
        <b>Home</b> = returns to default zoom and pan settings for the fractal<br />
    </p>
    <p>
        • <b>Coloring Algorithms</b> = the algorithm used for mapping complex space of the
        Julia set to a colored image space.<br />
        As only 256 colors are used to represent the fractal you can choose the preferred
        palette color set from 256 different palettes.<br />
        The cycling of the palette can be realized to the left or to the right. This cycling
        can be visualized as a shifting window over a circular palette of colors.<br />
        The screen saver animates the fractal by cycling its color palette. This is made
        at run time along with the refresh of the screen with a certain speed indicated
        by <b>Redraw speed</b>.<br />
        Painting fractals which are known for their infinite complexity comes with <i>a major
            drawback</i>. So the software cannot compute the exact color of <i>sharp edges</i>
        of the fractal due to the finite nature of the computers. <b>Anti-aliasing</b> (a
        2x multisampling method) is used to show a more precise picture of the fractal.
        This comes with a price: the colors of the image are outside the palette color set.
        This implies that this is just a <i>preview</i> and the animation is made on the
        original image.

        • <b><a name="fractalmusic">Fractal Music</a></b> = an interesting feature of the
        FractalSaver that is disabled by default.<br />
        Clicking the <b>Mute</b> checkbox you can check the fractal music by clicking on
        the <b>Play Sample</b> button. This will freeze the interface and release it after
        is done playing the fractal image 8 times shrinked. You can experiment Fractal Music
        with a range of 127 different instruments if and only if your sound card have <i>Synthesizer</i>
        capability (MIDI) and of course Volume of the <b>SW Synth</b> (Software Synthesizer)
        port is not muted. Please check!<br />
        A <b>Master Tempo</b> can control the speed at which the music is playing and can
        be set from the interface.<br />
        If you like the current settings you just have to click the <b>Apply</b> button
        and your screen saver is configured to your like.
