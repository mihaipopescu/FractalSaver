        What is FractalSaver ?</h2>
    <p>
        FractalSaver its a screensaver which displays an animated fractal. FractalSaver
        can also "play" the fractal music creating a strange abstract atmosphere. The visual
        and sound effects are created just using a simple mathematical formula and some
        mapping algorithms. FractalSaver is an open source project running on <a href="http://sourceforge.net">
            SourceForge</a>.

                    This <i>fractal seahorse</i> was found somewhere in the in the sea of complex numbers
                    but we lost it. It's very hard to pick the same point twice (there is almost infinite
                    number of possibilities) that's why he had became so precious to us that we even
                    named him as our project <i>logo and mascot</i>. His location is wanted and if you
                    find it please contact us and your name will enter in the <a href="legal.html">Credits
